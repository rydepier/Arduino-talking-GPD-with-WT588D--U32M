# Arduino-talking-GPS-with-WT588D--U32M
The third in a series of talking instruments for the visually impaired.

The WTD588D project file now contains high quality speech for a wide range of measuring instrument projects. It is part of a series of projects aimed at the Visually Impared. 

Using a WT588D - U 32m audio module and a GPS board (the one used here is an Adafruit Ultimate GPS, but any GPS board should work) to build a talking GPS. The WT588D is used in 3 line mode. For more information on this project see my blog here https://rydepier.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/arduino-talking-gps-with-wt588d-u32m/

The code used allows integer numbers up to 9999 and decimal numbers up to 9999.99 to be spoken easily.
