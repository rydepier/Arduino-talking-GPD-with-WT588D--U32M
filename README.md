# Arduino-talking-GPS-with-WT588D--U32M
The third in a series of talking instruments for the visually impaired.

The WTD588D project file now contains high quality speech for a wide range of measuring instrument projects. It is part of a series of projects aimed at the Visually Impared. 

Using a WT588D - U 32m audio module and a GPS board (the one used here is an Adafruit Ultimate GPS, but any GPS board should work) to build a talking GPS. The WT588D is used in 3 line mode. For more information on this project see my blog here 

The code used allows integer numbers up to 9999 and decimal numbers up to 9999.99 to be spoken easily.
